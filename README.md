>This project is part of the Master in Software Development. The objective was to create an a easy-to-use interface to manage employees information. The application user case starts with an user log in, and allows the user to read, create, delete and update the employee´s information. The user and employee data is stored in a database.

> This project objective is to create a file structure following the MVC pattern, with a basic router implementation and OOP approach.

   ### Main objectives:
● Connect your backend to your MySQL database
● Execute queries in your PHP code
● Adapt your code to work with classes and methods
● Improve your knowledge of MVC pattern
● Refactor the code of a existing project

## Where to start?🚀
### Install🔧

To clone this repository you have run in terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mhfortuna/php-employee-management-v1.git
```
Then you need to copy this folder to `htdocs` or change the server root variable.
After that, run a `npm install` in the root of the project, for all dependencies to install.

### Requirements📋

To run this project you need yo have XAMPP installed in your PC (or MUMP in the case of Mac users). For more information about XAMPP visit [their website](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html).

You need to have a database with all the employees and users in your mysql workspace. We provide you with all the required queries to create the database, its tables and insert mock data inside the **resources** folder.

Set your database configuration on the **config/db.php** file. (username, password, dbname etc.)


## Deployment📦

To open the file explorer just open a browser and go to [localhost](localhost)
You'll have to login, the credentials are:
```
email: admin@assemblerschool.com
pass: 123456
```
## How to use 💻

### Dashboard page
After you have logged in the application you'll see a grid with some of the employees data. From there you can add new employees or delete them. If you double click on an employee you can see more data in a new page called the **employee page**. If you press on the employee icon it will redirect you to the **employee page** too, but this time you'll have a form to create a new employee.

### Employee page
This page renders conditionaly of how you accesed it:
- Case 1 - double click on employee from dashboard:
In this view you will see the available employee data, and you can update any of the fields. It the `id` doesn't exist it will show an error and redirect you to the dashboard.
- Case 3 - Click on the employee icon from dashboard:
In this view you'll see the empty form to create a new employee. There are mandatory fields to fill. When you submit the new employee it will show a modal and redirect you to the dashboard.
